# 🧠 Doctor AI — Multi-Modal Medical Assistant

An intelligent **multi-modal AI system** that mimics how a real doctor communicates. Users can **speak** their symptoms and **upload an image**, and the bot will analyze the input using advanced **LLMs**, **vision models**, and **TTS synthesis** to deliver a **human-like medical voice response**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎤 **Voice Input**: Speak symptoms directly to the system
- 🖼️ **Image Upload**: Upload medical images (e.g., rashes, X-rays)
- 🧠 **LLM + Vision Analysis**: Uses GROQ's LLaMA-3 Vision model for intelligent reasoning
- 🔊 **Text-to-Speech Response**: Responds with a lifelike medical voice using TTS
- 🔄 **Multi-modal Fusion**: Combines voice and visual context for a better diagnosis
